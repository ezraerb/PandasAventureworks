Simple project to analyze aspects of a dataset using pandas. The dataset is Adventureworks,
one of the classic sets for learning data analysis. It simpulates a bicycle repair shop. It
contains enough tables and data to enable robust and interesting analysis, without being
overwhelming. It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres

This code was run on Python 3.9. Install needed packages with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

The code does three analyses to exercise various pandas functionality, and produces the
following output files:
inventory_by_product_model.csv - total inventory on hand broken out by product model
total_cost_by_location.csv - total cost to buy or produce all inventory at each location
total_product_discount_by_quarter.csv - difference between list price and actual selling price
  for all saleable products for which records exist, broken out by product and quarter
